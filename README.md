This project is a project i did for myself and i never really finished it(the backend isnt connected to the front and such).
The project was made for myself and I never really finished it (the backend isnt connected to the front and such).

Its basicly scraping news sites in isreal and semntic analyze them.
The analyzation process is searching for words that are in a list that an MIT Professor made that splits words in two kinds- positive and negative. The site can tell what news sites are more negative or positive and the general attitude of the country- if something bad is happening the program will notice a lot of negativity.

In the near future Im attend to finish the backend: Connect the main programm to a server that will run the scrapping program every 30 minutes, manipulate the data and pass it to the website.
